                <p>5 Mercedes Citaro</p>
                <h6>Safety.<br>
                    Mercedes-Benz is pursuing the vision of accident-free driving. The Mercedes-Benz integral safety
                    concept makes an important contribution towards achieving this aim.
                    <br>
                    Comfort & Design.<br>
                    The attractive Citaro doesn't just have particularly attractive, outwardly appreciable charm. Its
                    inner values are also especially convincing. That's because, here, every single centimetre was well
                    thought-out.

                    Jhonnny likes to drive them because they are so long.
